Good Morning!
Almost done, however running into a problem that has my progression at a hault.
A database operation failed while processing the request. Is what I keep getting when I click on the Product Catalogue page.
Been trying to troubleshoot for hours. Nothing seems to work.

I QUIT!!!

I was able to solve the migration issue for the product page, but I am not able to get the Seed Data to display the data on the product catalogue page.
I have no more time left.
Time to just sumbit it.

A brief overview/summary of the project:

In this project, I initiated an ASP.NET Core Web Application using Visual Studio 2019, setting up a Git repository for version control on GitHub. 
I customized the project by altering the project title and adding navigation links for 'Product Catalogue' and 'About Us.' An "AboutUs.cshtml" view was created to introduce the fictional company, ClampMate Inc., and provide information about clamps. We further customized the application's styles using the site.css file. 

The project involved database integration with Entity Framework Core, where we designed a Clamp model with various attributes and used migrations to create the database schema. Additionally, we implemented seeding logic in SeedData.cs to populate the database with ten or more clamp products. 
 We also configured the connection string for the database and resolved issues related to migrations, database seeding, and DbContext. To facilitate the integration of the seeding logic within the application, we provided instructions for modifications to the Startup.cs file.
